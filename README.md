astro.js
========

A Javascript library for astronomy. 

This is the start of an idea and is subject to change. The plan is to make a Javascript framework for astronomy analagous to [astropy](https://github.com/astropy/astropy). I've been playing about with making a core Javascript function that deals with package management: astro.js. The aim would be to keep this core small and a developer would only need to load the dependencies they needed rather than a massive library.
