astro.js
========

A Javascript library for astronomy. 

The plan is to make a Javascript framework for astronomy analagous to [astropy](https://github.com/astropy/astropy). As a start I've made a core Javascript function that deals with package management: astro.js. The aim is to keep this core small and people who make use of the library only need to load the dependencies they need rather than a massive library. I will try to mirror the structure of astropy where possible.
